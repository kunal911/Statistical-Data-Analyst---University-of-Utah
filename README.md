# Statistical-Data-Analyst---University-of-Utah

## Mental Health Screening Analysis
This repository contains code and analysis for a school-based mental health screening initiative. The primary objective is to analyze data collected from teacher surveys and student assessments to assess mental health risks and wellbeing among students across various schools.

## Project Overview
As a Statistical Data Analyst, I have been involved in this project, collaborating with the Department of Psychology at the University of Utah. My role has been to clean, code, and perform statistical analyses on the collected data using Python and R software. Additionally, I have been responsible for graphing and interpreting ongoing aggregate mental health trends for both individual students and across different schools.
Through this project, I have applied my expertise in data analysis, statistical modeling, and data visualization techniques to derive actionable insights. These insights aim to aid in the enhancement of student well-being within educational settings by providing a comprehensive understanding of mental health risks and identifying areas for intervention and support.
